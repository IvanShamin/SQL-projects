DataCamp project (completed February 2026)

## Project Goal
Clean and analyze a Super Store sales dataset:
- Identify top 5 products per category by sales/profit
- Impute missing `quantity` values using unit price calculated from discount/market/region

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- PostgreSQL queries
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Joins (USING)
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG)
- Window functions (RANK)
- Data cleaning & imputation (handling NULLs)

## Files
- `analysis.sql` → all project queries

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL (via DataLab)
- DataCamp project environment

## Results Highlights
- Top products identified per category
- Missing quantities successfully imputed (rounded to whole numbers)

Repository created for portfolio purposes.
